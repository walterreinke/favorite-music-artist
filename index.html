              The first two lines of this lyric show that Earl has stumbled a
              lot throughout his life. The second two lines are a reference to
              his mother, who has been his rock throughout his life. The last
              two lines are about Earl being isolated, but continuing to try to
              be a good force in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love this lyric because it encapsulates all the ups and downs
              that Earl has been through. This lyric, song, and entire album
              even, encapsulate Earl's life and all of the struggles he has been
              through. If you haven't listened to this album, I would highly
              recommend it, and I would recommend Earl's entire discography.
